/**
 * USA — Universal Software Auditor
 * Core type definitions.

 * Design note: USA deliberately separates two orthogonal axes that most audit
 * checklists conflate:
 *
 *   SEVERITY  = how bad it is *if this rule is violated* (impact).
 *   STATUS    = what the audit actually observed (outcome).
 *
 * The emoji tags in USA.md map onto these two axes (see `TAG_TABLE`) so the
 * report still reads like a classic severity-tagged audit while the underlying
 * model stays machine-checkable and scoreable.
